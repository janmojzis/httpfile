.TP
.B \-h \fIcustom header\fR
Add \fIcustom header\fR to the HTTP response. The maximum is 8 \fIcustom header\fRs.
.TP
.I root
run chrooted in the directory \fIroot\fR.

.B \fIUID/GID\fR run under the uid and gid specified by the $UID and $GID environment variables
.SH INTERFACE

most \fBhttpfile\fR properties are inherited from publicfile\-0.76
.RS 0
.nf
Normally \fBhttpfile\fR is run under tcpserver/inetd/systemd/... to handle HTTP connections from hosts around the Internet.
\fBhttpfile\fR prints requested public files from the \fIroot\fR directory hierarchy see FILE HANDLING. Normally \fIroot\fR is /var/www/httpfile.
\fBhttpfile\fR accepts GET and HEAD requests and prohibits POST, PUT, DELETE, ...
\fBhttpfile\fR HTTP/1.0, and HTTP/1.1 formats.
\fBhttpfile\fR has exact\-prefix support for If\-Modified\-Since: it uses code 304 if the Last\-Modified contents are an exact prefix of the If\-Modified\-Since contents.
\fBhttpfile\fR support basic authentication see BASIC AUTHORIZATION.
\fBhttpfile\fR accepts range requests.

.SH FILE HANDLING
.RS 0
.nf
A request for http://<host>/<file> refers to the file named ./<host>/<file> inside the \fIroot\fR directory hierarchy, if <file> does not end with a slash.
A request for http://<host>/<dir>/ refers to the file named ./<host>/<dir>/index.html.
\fBhttpfile\fR always converts the host name v to lowercase. If HTTP/1.0 requests do not specify a host name; in this case \fBhttpfile\fR uses the host name '0'.
A request for http://<host>/<dir> is redirected to http://<host>/<dir>/, which refers to the file named ./<host>/<dir>/index.html.
.fi
.TP
\fBhttpfile\fR does not allow dots immediately after slashes in file names. It changes these dots to colons before attempting to open the file.
.SH BASIC AUTHORIZATION
.RS 0
.nf
\fBhttpfile\fR supports basic authentication using a special file (e.g. named pipe) trick.
A request for http://<host>/<dir>/<specialfile> returns HTTP response 401. Browser than sends request with authorization header "Authorization: Basic <base64_credentials>".
Then request for http://<host>/<file> refers to the file named ./@<base64_credentials_without_'='_pading>/<host>/<file>.
.fi
